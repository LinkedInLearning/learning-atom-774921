# Learning Atom
Moving Around and Bookmarks

> > Author Notes:

# Introduction
Within a document, there are a number of command keys that will help you navigate through a document.

You can click on the status bar to navigate to any line number. You can also pull up this window by using control-g

## Symbols
You can also navigate by something called symbols. Atom will analyze your document and let you jump to important sections by using cmd-r. Let's look for the title of the current document. This document uses section.

This is context sensitive, so it will adjust to the type of file you open. It's sort of a quick find.

## Bookmarks
You can also create bookmarks in a very long document to highlight sections that you want to come back to.

You can press command-F2 to toggle a bookmark. This is alt-control-F2 on a PC. Remember that on some machines and depending on how you set things up, you might have to hit another key, usually an FN to access function keys.

A bookmark symbol is added to the gutter

If you hit F2, the editor will jump to the next bookmark, shift F2 will move backwards.

To view all of the bookmarks in a list, just hit Control-F2 on a PC or Mac.

# Conclusion
Of course you can also navigate to content by finding, but that's a little more involved than simply navigating your document. We'll take a look at the find and replace functionality in the next video.
