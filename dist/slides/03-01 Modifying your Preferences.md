# Learning Atom
Modifying Your Preferences

> > Author Notes:

# Introduction
Let's take a look at some of the ways you can adjust Atom to your needs. Of course in most applications you usually do that through preferences. Atom has such a rich set of adjustments that they're subdivided into different segments.

Let's pull up settings from the file menu.

General settings, which we'll cover in this video as well as keybindings, packages and themes.  There are also things that are not in settings...for example ways of creating your own snippets and changing the styles that Atom uses to display it's interface. We'll take a look at those in other videos.

When working with settings, it's really useful to pull these side by side with an existing editor pane so you can see how they will affect your current document.

I think some of these are pretty easy to figure out by reading the descriptions, so I'm going to focus on the ones that are think aren't as clear or are especially useful to web developers

# Conclusion
There's a lot of great preferences in here so you can get most of the editor working just like you want to, so spend some time tweaking things just the way you like them.
