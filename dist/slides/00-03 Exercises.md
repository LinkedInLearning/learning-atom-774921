Introductory Statement
========================
If you are a premium member you have access to the exercise files used throughout this title.

Explanation of Exercise Files
------------------

This project is a bit different than most, in the exercise files folder, you'll find a single folder called Atom. I usually have this folder open in my editor at the beginning of most movies.

Since this course is about learning Atom, the text editor, you can really work with your own assets, but my files are really useful for the last few videos, where I talk about Git and Github integration.

Conclusion
=======================
Of course, if you are a monthly member or annual member, you donâ€™t have access to the exercise files, but you can follow along from scratch with your own assets.
