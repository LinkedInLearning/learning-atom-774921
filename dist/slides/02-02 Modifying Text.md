Modifying Text

> > Author Notes:

# Introduction
In addition to changing lines, there's a couple of ways to modify text elements.

For example you can convert an element to a comment, by hitting command-forwardslash. That's control forward slash on a PC. It's pretty cool because it is context sensitive, so it can detect where you are in the document and comment accordingly.

There's a couple of other options to convert text to uppercase and lowercase under the edit menu.

There are also some other options which I find a little strange to delete text to certain line positions.

I do like that there is an option to delete an entire line quickly with control-shift-k

# Conclusion
Some of these are more useful than others, I'm not sure I would use the delete to word options, but hey, someone else might think that's the coolest feature in the app.
