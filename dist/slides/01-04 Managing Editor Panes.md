# Learning Atom
Managing Editor Panes

> > Author Notes:

# Introduction
Another important aspect of working with multiple documents in Atom is learning how to work with multiple editor panes. You can split your editor into multiple sub-sections horizontally or vertically to make it easier to compare and analyze multiple documents in your project.

To create an editor pane, you can hit command-k. ..that's control-k on a PC and then one of the arrows. Atom will open a new pane in relation to the currently selected pane. So if you hit command-k and then the right arrow, it will open a pane to the right. If you then hit command-k and then down, it creates a pane at the bottom. Now you can see that what it is doing is splitting the pane with the current focus on.

Of course you can do this through the menus as well, but it is much easier and handier to do this via the keyboard shortcuts.

One of the problems with opening up panes in this way is that it leaves the current document open. So to me the best way to open a new pane is to right click on the document in the tree viewand then choose one of the split option from the popup menu.

To close a pane, you simply close all of its tabs.

Each of these panes has it's own set of tabs. and you can move tabs around by click and dragging them.

Atom also has a couple of ways of finding files quicker. You can search through the files that are in the 'buffer' or in memory by using the find buffer command. That's command-b (control-b on a pc) and then use the box to type in the name of the file you want or use the arrow keys.

If you want to find a file within a project, you can hit command-b (control-b on a PC) and search for anything in the current project.

You can even combine open a new tab from the find in buffer by hitting command-t, then before you click on the article to open it, hit the keyboard shortcuts to open the document in a new tab.

# Conclusion
You can save a lot of effort if you spend some time learning the shortcuts. Working with tabs and using the tool to locate files will definitely make you faster when working on projects.
