# Learning Atom
Using Packages

> > Author Notes:

# Introduction
The atom editor that's installed by default is actually a much smaller piece of software that looks like a more complete application because it comes with a number of extensions called pacakges. The fact that it's so modular makes it a really easy to customize to your needs.

It's surprising how many packages actually ship and install with atom, there are more than 70 packages that ship with Atom. You can check them out by look at the packages section in preferences. Here's the full list of installed packages and you can filter them by name.

You can easily disable packages by clicking on the pause button
If you want to modify how the packages work, you can click on the settings button.

Honestly, some of these are sort of odd, so for example, you can turn ouf the about Atom dialog box by turning that package off, and then if you go to the about menu, you get...an empty text box. Obviously there are some packages that are more useful than others.

For example, I have a problem with the wrap-guide. It sort of shows you a vertical line to suggest that you write code that is no longer than a certain width. But I'm not sure it's my editor's job to critique how many columns my code is taking, so I can turn that off if I want to.

Also, if there are some languages that you're not using, then you can turn those languages off. For example, if you don't use Atom to write objective-c code, then turn that off.

A lot of these packages will let you modify their functionality through settings. For example, one of the modifications I've made is under the tabs package. That's because right now, if I click on a file, it opens in a new tab even if I don't want it to. So if you turn this on, the tabs will only show if you double click on the file. You can also choose to not show the tab bar unless there is more than one document open.

Another good one to check, for web developers, is the tree view package. It controls what you see in the the file tree view. You can for example Hide VCS ignored files, so that if you have a gitignore file, any matches in that file will hide. You can also ask for folders to be sorted at the top of the tree.

If you have any packages installed, you can look under a community packages section. Here are some of my favorite packages.

language-postcss
linter
linter-jshint
open-in-browser
open-terminal-here
sort-lines
pigments

# Conclusion
Other than installing and basic customization, packages are the main way that you control how the application works.
