# Learning Atom

Downloading and Installing Atom

> > Author Notes:

# Introduction

Let's take a look at how to get and update Atom including installing some of the terminal tools that will help you take things to a new level. Atom was created by the same team that created Github, so before you install Atom, make sure you've installed Git.

To get a copy of Atom on your machine, you can go to the website Atom.io and click on the download button for your platform. So what you might see here will be different depending on wether you're using a Mac, a PC or a Linux machine.

## Mac Install

Atom was originally built for Mac, so let's take a look at the setup in that platform first.

--Walk through install

## Windows

The windows installer will add the atom and apm commands to your PATH

- create shortcuts on the desktop and in the start menu
- Add an Open with Atom context menu in the Explorer.

# Welcome Screens

When you first open Atom, you'll see a number of different welcome screens. They're loaded in different tabs on your screen.

## Welcome

This welcome has a few interesting links to documentation, a discussion forum and a link to all of the packages, which are plugins you can add to extend Atom.

This screen will appear everytime you launch Atom unless you click on this button here.

## Telemetry Consent

If you want to, you can have Atom automatically send some usage stats to allow Github to improve the product. If you don't want to provide this information, you can click on this button.

## Welcome Guide

The welcome guide is a list of interactive highlights that will show you some of the features of the application.

This will also appear every time you start Atom. If you want to get rid of this one, you can uninstall it too. This Welcome Screen is a package, which is what Atom calls it's plugins or extensions. We'll cover these in a later video, but in the meantime, you can go to

Go to the **Atom** menu and choose **Preferences** (FILE>Settings on Windows), Click on the Packages Item and then click on the Installed packages. You're looking for a package called welcome. When you find it, click on the **disable** button.

Now Quit and re-run Atom and it should come up with a blank window.

# Conclusion

Now that we've installed Atom and run over the basic settings, it's time to get accustomed to the interface.
