Introductory Statement
========================
Hey there, it's ray again and thanks for watching this course. If you want to learn more about Atom, the best place to go is the documentation at Atom.io.

There's a really good search there for both packages and themes and you can see popular and trending content. The documentation for Atom is called the Flight Manual and you can get it in different formats.

The blog shows you the latest news and releases about this editor, and finally discuss things. If you're into slack, Atom also has an excellent Slack board where you can interact with other users.
