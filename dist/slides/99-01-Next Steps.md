Introductory Statement
========================
Hey there, it's ray again and thanks for watching this course. If you want to learn more about Atom, the best place to go is the documentation at Atom.io.

There's a really good search there for both packages and themes and you can see popular and trending content.

The documentation for Atom is called the Flight Manual and you can get it in different formats. Sometimes it's nice to have the docs in PDF or epub form so I can pull it up in my iPad while I'm working with the app.

The blog shows you the latest news and releases about this editor, and finally discuss things. If you're into slack, Atom also has an excellent Slack board where you can interact with other users.

If you're using Atom as an editor, I highly suggest that you also think about managing your projects with Git and Github and we've got a couple of courses to help you there.
