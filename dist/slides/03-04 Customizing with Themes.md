Customizing With Themes

> > Author Notes:


# Introduction
You can modify the way Atom looks through settings in themes. There are two types of themes in Atom. 

- [ ] The first is the UI theme, which controls the tabs, status bar, tree view and certain dropdowns.

- [ ] The syntax theme controls how your code looks.

- [ ] Let's try changing the theme.

- [ ] Some themes allow you to change things like the font sizes and other settings. If the theme lets you do that, you'll see a gear icon next to the dropdown.

- [ ] You'll also see a settings button under the theme list.

- [ ] You can of course search through the list with a search box. Themes are downloaded and stored with your installation.

- [ ] To go back to the themes list, you can hit the themes link at the top. There's one more way of getting to the theme settings.

- [ ]  If the theme has modifiable settings, you'll see a list of them here first, then you'll see a description of the theme with features and usually a screenshot of the theme.

- [ ] There's a another way to see theme information. You can see a link to view on Atom.io right here. That will take you to a website where you can see the same information.

- [ ] From the website, you can hit the themes menu link at the top to see a searchable list of theemes.

- [ ] Atom ships with just a handful of themes. but you can download a lot more in the install section, just switch to the themes tab.

- [ ] Search for isotope-light, isotope-ui, change settings.
