Customizing With Themes

> > Author Notes:


# Introduction
You can modify the way Atom looks through settings in themes. There are two types of themes in Atom. 

-[] The first is the UI theme, which controls the tabs, status bar, tree view and certain dropdowns.

-[] The syntax theme controls how your code looks.

-[] Let's try changing the theme.

-[] Some themes allow you to change things like the font sizes and other settings. If the theme lets you do that, you'll see a gear icon next to the dropdown.

-[] You'll also see a settings button under the theme list.

-[] You can of course search through the list with a search box. Themes are downloaded and stored with your installation.

-[] To go back to the themes list, you can hit the themes link at the top. There's one more way of getting to the theme settings.

-[]  If the theme has modifiable settings, you'll see a list of them here first, then you'll see a description of the theme with features and usually a screenshot of the theme.

-[] There's a another way to see theme information. You can see a link to view on Atom.io right here. That will take you to a website where you can see the same information.

-[] From the website, you can hit the themes menu link at the top to see a searchable list of theemes.

- [] Atom ships with just a handful of themes. but you can download a lot more in the install section, just switch to the themes tab.
