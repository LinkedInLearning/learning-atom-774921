Folding Brackets

> > Author Notes:

# Introduction
One of the problems when working with HTML documents is that there's often a lot of encapsulation of tags, so you end up with a lot of tags that are inside other tags and sometimes that makes the document hard to debug, especially on documents like there with a lot of content.

## Folding

One of the cool features in Atom makes it easier to simplify the structure in a document.

This is called folding and one way to do it is by using the icons in the gutter. Whenever you see a tag that has a corresponding closing version, you'll be able to click on a triangle to close it.

You can tell some text is folded by looking at the gutter or a little icon with three lines on the right of the fold.

Of course, there are command keys to take care of this. You can use command-option and then the brackets (that's control-alt on a PC) to fold and unfold the text.

If you add the shift key to that, you can fold and unfold the entire document. See how easy it makes it to find the key areas of content in a document.

This works in different ways depending on the file type.

If you want to see a little more detail, you can even control how many levels of folding you can see.

It's easy to do that through the menus

Or you can do that through the keyboard, but it's a little tricky. First you hit the command-k and then command-# (that's control-k and control-# on a PC)

# Conclusion
Folding is super handy and makes it much easier to undestand what is going on with some documents. Once you get used to this feature, it will make your life easier.
