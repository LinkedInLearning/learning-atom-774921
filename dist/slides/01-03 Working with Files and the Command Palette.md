# Learning Atom

Working with Files and the Command Palette

> > Author Notes:

# Introduction

There are several ways to open items in Atom. Obviously, you can use the file menu to open files and handle traditional file operations.

You can open files through the terminal with the Atom command. This is sometimes an optional install that you can do from the FILE menu on a mac and the HELP menu on a PC.

You can also open items through the file menu. You can open individual files or different folder.

If you open folders, they will open in a new window.

In addition, you can open multiple folders from different locations into the same tree view by choosing add project folder.

##Command Palette
Another way to open files and really perform just about anything in Atom is to use the command palette.

You can get to it by going to packages/command palette and then toggle command palette. Obviously, that's a bit hidden, so you can use the command key. On a PC, that's Control-Shift-P.

From here, you can access any command. Notice that it will also let you access the key bindings, so you can see what the shortcuts are for each command.

# Conclusion

There's just a few differences between how atom and other traditional file operations work. The main thing is the concept of projects and multiple project folders. The command palette is useful for a lot more than just opening files, so make sure you learn the command key for your platform. You'll end up using it often.
