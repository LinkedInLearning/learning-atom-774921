Explanation of Exercise Files
------------------

This project is a bit different than most, in the exercise files folder, you'll find a couple of folders. I usually have on or more of these open in my editor at the beginning each video so that I can show you different features in the editor. But feel free to use your own files.

There's also a Github repo where you can find these files at this URL.

This is a beginner course for most videos, but I'm going to assume you've put together some web projects previously. Also, in the videos discussing Git and Github, I'm going to assume you have some experience with Git and Github.
