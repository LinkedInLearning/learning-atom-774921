# Introduction
So far, we've been focusing on actions that let you look at and organize content. Let's take a look at a few features that let you modify content.

I'm going to start with one of the features I use most often. I really like to organize the structure of my HTML tags so that they are visually indented. It let's me analyze the structure of my tags.

Most of these options are going to be under the edit menus under lines.

You can indent and outdent content by selecting it and then using the command key (control on a pc) and then the brackets. The right bracket indents the content and the left one outdents the content.

There's another option that will try to auto indent some content for you. First you have to make a selection and then you can

You can also take a line and move it around with command keys. That can be useful in lists or other items where you want to control the order.

To do that, you use command-control (that's just the control key on a PC) and then use the up and down arrows.

You can duplicate a line with command-shift-d (control-shift-d on a PC)

If you want to delete a line, you can hit control-shift-k on a mac or pc.

There are also some options in that menu to sort things.


# Conclusion
There's quite a few options that help you rearrange lines. I think some of them are handier than others, I would suggest that you play around with the options and see which ones would help your workflow become more efficient.
