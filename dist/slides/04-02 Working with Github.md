# Learning Atom
Working with Github

> > Author Notes:

# Introduction
There's a lot of commands that help you work with your Github content, so let's take a look. All of these require that you have a github repo related to this project. So these won't work unless you've got that. If you need help setting that up.

The simplest command allows you to open the current file on GitHub
alt-G O

alt-G B
Open blame of file on GitHub. The blame file shows you who made changes to a file over time. That can help you see how a file was modified over time and if you're working on a project with other users, you can more specifically see who did them.

alt-G H
Open history of file on GitHub. This is more of a quite overview of the commits themselves.

alt-G C
Copy the URL of the current file on GitHub. That way you can take it into something like the terminal easier.

alt-G-I would show you any issues on github. Issues are a way to keept track of tasks or bugs for your projects. They're like email. It lets people comment on your code.

alt-G R
Branch compare on GitHub. THis one takes a bit of explaining to do.

# Conclusion
The github commands in Atom help you with very common tasks. I would still use the terminal for most of my projects, but it's nice to have some fo these to quickly look things up and compare how the project works with github.
