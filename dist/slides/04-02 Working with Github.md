Installing and Configuring Atom IDE

> > Author Notes:

# Introduction
Another great package you can get for Atom is called Atom IDE, it's actually a group of packages that give you better language integration.

So, for example, you'll get better auto completion, auto-completion, this really nice outline view, hover-to-reveal information, better error checking and document formatting.

This is a separate installation, so to get it you have to to the package manager and download and install the IDE.


Atom IDE doesn't really do much by itself. In order to get the most out of it, you'll need to install some additional packages.


ide-css, ide-html, ide-typescript, ide-json
